    <h2>Simple Steps in Registering a Company in Nigeria</h2>

<p>Registering a company in Nigeria, means incorporating is a legal entity, which 

also means that your company will become a corporate entity once 

incorporated.  </p>

In Nigeria we have three (3) types of private companies and they are: company 

limited by shares, company limited by guarantee and unlimited company. We 

also have public companies; this we would not be elucidating. </p>

It is pertinent to know that the law that regulates companies in Nigeria is 

called Company and Allied Matters Act (CAMA). This law handles the structure 

of companies, the process of incorporation and the rules governing the 

operation of companies in Nigeria. </p>

<h3>The following steps of registering a company are listed below:</h3>

<p><b>Step 1: <em> Name Reservation </em></b> - This is the process of checking if the name you 

will be using already exist and this is the first step you need to take in 

the process of registering your company. This process is conducted on the cac 

website and the cost is FREE. https://search.cac.gov.ng/home</p>

<p><b>Step 2: <em> Register your Details</em></b> - You are expected to provide your full details 

as you fill the form.  The following are some of the document required for 

the registration of your company:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Memorandum and Articles of Association</li>
    <li>Registered Address of the Business</li>
    <li>List, particulars and consent of the Director/Directors of the company </li>
    </ul> <br>
Step 3: <b><em>Payment </em> </b>- You are expected to make the required payment through the 

cac portal as well as upload all required document. Once your payment is 

confirm and document processed in course, your electronic certificate will be 

sent to you immediately.</p>

<p>NB: If you don't want to go through the hassle of registering the company 

yourself, you can contact us directly.</p>
